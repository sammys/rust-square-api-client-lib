/// Most discounts should use `MODIFY_TAX_BASIS`. However, in some circumstances taxes must be
/// calculated based on an item's price, ignoring a particular discount. For example, in many US
/// jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a customer pays but
/// does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is due. In this case,
/// the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for
/// this field.
